This project focuses on classifying Electromyography (EMG) signals acquired using an OpenBCI device at the LAM laboratory at Simón Bolívar University. The data was collected in a single continuous session, with each phase recorded for a specific duration: a 2-minute baseline state, followed by 1-minute intervals for forward neck movement, backward neck movement, right neck movement, left neck movement, and a state of resting thought. The goal is to develop an AI model capable of classifying these distinct states, enabling it to recognize a person's intended movement when the experiment is replicated
